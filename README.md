# CureIt Productivity App

Welcome to CureIt, your ultimate productivity companion! CureIt is designed to help you stay focused, manage your time effectively, and track your progress towards your goals. With a range of features aimed at boosting productivity and controlling distractions, CureIt empowers you to make the most out of your day.

## Features

### Credit Activities
With CureIt, you can credit activities that you complete, earning virtual money as a reward. Whether it's finishing a task, exercising, or learning something new, you'll be incentivized to stay productive and accomplish your goals.

### Enjoy Feature
The Enjoy feature allows you to use the virtual money you've earned to access selected apps that you've added to your list. By spending your virtual currency wisely, you can indulge in recreational activities guilt-free while staying mindful of your productivity.

### Transaction History
Keep track of your progress and spending with the Transaction History feature. View detailed records of your credits, expenditures, and statistics to better understand your productivity habits and make informed decisions.

### Addiction Control
Take control of your digital distractions with CureIt's Addiction Control feature. Hide distracting apps from your main screen and access them only through the app. By managing your distractions effectively, you can maintain focus and productivity throughout your day.

### Dividing Time Over a Long Term
CureIt helps you maintain balance by discouraging excessive focus on certain activities. If you spend too much time on a particular domain, you'll earn less virtual money for completing tasks in that area. This encourages you to distribute your time and attention more evenly, promoting long-term productivity and well-being.

### Mood Tracking (Coming Soon)
Stay tuned for the upcoming Mood Tracking feature, designed to help you understand how your mood impacts your productivity. By tracking your emotions over time, you'll gain valuable insights into your productivity patterns and learn how to optimize your workflow accordingly.
